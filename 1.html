            The mobile phone can be used to communicate over long distances without wires. It works by communicating with a nearby base station (also called a "mobile tower") which connects it to the main phone network. When moving, if the mobile phone gets too far away from the cell it is connected to, that cell sends a message to another cell to tell the new cell to take over the call. This is called a "hand off," and the call continues with the new cell the phone is connected to. The hand-off is done so well and carefully that the user will usually never even know that the call was transferred to another cell.

           <h1><center> I RECIVE MY PHONE </center></h1>
           <p class="div2p"> QualityI recieved my first cell phone when I was 9, which seems more normal now than it was at the time. Of course I thought I was so cool being the only kid in my class with a cell phone, telling everyone; but it was because I was always home alone and my mom thought I needed one in case of emergencies. My mom always worked nights, so before she thought I could be home alone I always had different babysitters, some better than others. I remember distinctly this one babysitter I had that drug me on a bus to the mall, with all of her friends. I remember she found a stuffed animal on the road, and was waving it at cars trying to sell it. I’m not sure why I remember this so vividly when I seem to not be able to remember anything. My mom and dad were …show more content…
She never helped me with my homework even when I asked, she never asked me how my day was or did the little things all my friends parents did. She acted strange when I had friends over, and would always hide in her room and make everyone else feel uncomfortable. She would never go shopping with me because ‘the tiles on the floor in the mall made her anxious’. At the time I didn’t understand, and I thought she just didn’t want to do things with me. I was always at my friend’s houses, more close with their parents than my own. And I was always jealous that their moms did things for them like laundry, and making them dinner when mine didn’t. I’m grateful now that I can be independent and do those things on my own, when my 21-year-old friends cannot; but at the time that was the last thing I was thinking of. My mom never understood why I never wanted to be home, but when I was home I would just sit in my room by myself and so would she. I remember lashing out at her, crying barely able to get my words out, asking why don’t you care? She immediately was defensive and yelled back. All of high school, my mom and I fought constantly. Every time she yelled at me. </p>

           <p>As mobile phones became more popular, they began to cost less money, and more people could afford them. Monthly plans became available for rates as low as US$30 or US$40 a month. Cell phones have become so cheap to own that they have mostly replaced pay phones and phone booths except for urban areas with many people </p>

           <p> In the 21st century, a new type of mobile phone, called smartphones, have become popular. Since the 2010s, more people use smartphones than the old kind of mobile phone, which are called feature phones. </p>
